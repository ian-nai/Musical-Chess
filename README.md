# Musical-Chess
Music generated by moves on a chessboard in pure Javascript. Play your own moves or paste a PGN into the text box to create a MIDI file. Each file is associated with a major key, with each square in the file corresponding to one note in the scale.

# About
This web app was primarily inspired by John Cage's piece *Reunion*, performed with Marcel Duchamp. You can read about the piece [at this link](http://www.openculture.com/2017/09/when-john-cage-marcel-duchamp-played-chess-on-a-chessboard-that-turned-chess-moves-into-electronic-music-1968.html). 

The PGN is grabbed from the Javascript chessboard and converted into music, with each square corresponding to a pre-determined note.
